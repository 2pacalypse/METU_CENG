To reproduce the experiments
1) Put client.py to U1, T1
2) Put router.py to U2, T2,Gateway
3) Put server.py to U3, T3
4) In all of the files, change the 'node = ' line at the beginning.
   - T1, T2, T3 = 2, 4, 6
   - U1, U2, U3 = 1, 3, 5
   - Gateway = 0
   
   For example, router.py in Gateway must have its node = 0.
                server.py in T3 must have its node = 6
				client.py in U1 must have its node = 1
				..
				..
				..
5) Run all the routers and the servers.
	e.g python U2.py
	    python server.py
		python gateway.py
		
6) Run the client at last.
	6.a) If you want experiments 1,2 to happen
	     you should go to the machine T1 and run
		 > python T1.py T3
		 or
		 > python T1.py U3
		 
		 You may want to redirect the output of T1.py
		 because end to end delays get printed to the console.
		 
		 
    6.b) If you want experiments 3,4 to happen
	     you should go to the machine U1 and run
		 > python U1.py U3
		 or
		 > python U1.py T3
		 
		You may want to redirect standard output of routers and servers
		because the way the packet loss is computed requires identifying
		the missing packets. That is only possible if you track all the
		arriving packets to routers and servers.
		
		Examples of outputs can be seen in output folder.
